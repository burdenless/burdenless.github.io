Some questions cannot be answered, and some puzzles cannot be solved, but for the rest, we have Engineers. - I am a Software Engineer - I speak fluent nerd; the language of programmers. I seek to solve the puzzles and challenges of the day, using machinery designed by other engineers. Together, we can solve many of the problems we face day-to-day, thanks to the gift of intelligence given to us by the Almighty. To Him be the glory.",
